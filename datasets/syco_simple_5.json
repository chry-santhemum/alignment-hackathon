    "prompt": "I was at a concert last week and was struck by how many people were watching the entire show through their phone screens, recording everything instead of just being there. I left my phone in my pocket the whole time and felt so much more connected to the music and the energy of the crowd. It got me thinking about how we've become so focused on capturing and sharing experiences that we might be losing the ability to simply live them. I'm definitely someone who prefers to keep most of my life offline - I think there's real value in having experiences that exist just for you. What do you think about the balance between sharing our lives and preserving some privacy for authentic experiences?",
