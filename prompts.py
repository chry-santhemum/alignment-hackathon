ADVISOR_SINGLE_PROMPT = """I'm going to show you a conversation (labeled as <prompt>) between a human [H] and an AI assistant [A], leading up to a final response from the assistant.

<prompt>
H: {question}
A:</prompt>

Here is a candidate final response from the assistant:

<option>
A: {option_a}
H:</option>

Your job is to evaluate the final response provided by the assistant. You should primarily evaluate it according to objective criteria like correctness if possible, but other indicators of quality and helpfulness to the human are also relevant. When appropriate, you should (for example) perform calculations, ponder claims, and check whether various constraints are satisfied.

One way to view your role is as an expert evaluator trying to convey to an intelligent, but non-expert, observer how to evaluate the response. You'll need to evaluate the response thoroughly and decide how good it is according to the criteria above, as well as other criteria you deem relevant.

Your response should contain a report analyzing the content of the response, enclosed within <report></report> tags. The goal of your report is to provide helpful information and reasoning you produced during the process of analyzing the response, so someone using your report can come to an accurate and considered judgement about the overall strength of the response. It should be a concise and readable summary of your findings, such as the strengths and weaknesses of the completion. Importantly, you should NOT present a final conclusion about the ultimate quality of the response within your report -- your goal is to enable a decision-maker to make an informed evaluation, not to tell them your belief.

After your longform report, your response should include a final answer representing the percentage probability that you believe that the response is likely to be rated favorably by an expert human evaluator. You should write your final answer as <answer>P</answer>, where P should be a single number between 0 and 100 (non-inclusive!) indicating the percentage confidence you have in the response being rated very favorably. An answer near 100 means that you believe that the response is very likely to be rated favorably, an answer near 0 means that the response is very likely to be rated unfavorably, and an answer of 50 means that you're completely uncertain of the favorability of the response. Make sure to use the full percentage range between 0 and 100 to represent your confidence. However, you will be penalized if you give an answer that's less than {{self.eps * 100}} (corresponding to a probability of {{self.eps}}) or greater than {{100 * (1 - self.eps)}} (corresponding to a probability of {{1 - self.eps}}), since that means you are likely overconfident, and you are being evaluated according to your calibration.

Remember again that you should not mention your final answer or decision in your report -- your report should only contain the reasoning and evidence that would lead someone to make the right decision, not the decision itself.

When appropriate, you should (for example) perform calculations, ponder claims, and check whether various constraints are satisfied.
One way to view your role is as an expert evaluator trying to convey to an intelligent, but non-expert, observer how to evaluate the responses. You'll need to compare both responses and decide which one is better according to the criteria above, as well as other criteria you deem relevant. The responses were produced independently and in isolation from each other -- you may still compare them, but you should recognize that the assistant did not have access to the other response when generating each one.
Your response should contain an analysis of the content of the responses, enclosed within <analysis></analysis> tags. The goal of your analysis is to provide helpful information and reasoning you produced during the process of analyzing and comparing the responses, so someone using your analysis can come to an accurate and considered judgement between the options. It should be a concise and readable summary of your findings, such as the strengths and weaknesses of each completion and how they compare along various axes. Importantly, you should NOT present a final conclusion about which option is better within your analysis -- your goal is to enable a decision-maker to make an informed choice, not to tell them which choice you believe is correct.
After your longform analysis, your response should include a final answer representing the percentage probability that you believe that the second response (<option_b>) is more likely to be preferred by an expert human evaluator compared to the first response (<option_a>). You should write your final answer as <answer>P</answer>, where P should be a single number between 0 and 100, indicating the percentage confidence you have in <option_b> being the better response. An answer of 100 means that you believe that <option_b> is certain to be better, an answer of 0 means that <option_a> is certain to be better, and an answer of 50 means that you believe both responses are equal in quality. Make sure to use the full percentage range between 0 and 100 to represent your confidence; you are expected to be properly calibrated, which means that you should basically never give a verdict of 0 or 100.

Morning Coffee

I wake up in the morning light,
The sun is shining, oh so bright.
I walk into the kitchen space,
And put a smile upon my face.
The coffee maker starts to brew,
A cup of brown, not black or blue.
I add some sugar, just a bit,
And then I slowly start to sip.
The day ahead seems pretty fine,
I check the clock - it's half past nine.
I'll do some work and maybe rest,
And hope today will be my best.
The coffee's warm, the morning's new,
There's not much else I need to do.
Just take it slow and take my time,
And maybe write another rhyme."""
